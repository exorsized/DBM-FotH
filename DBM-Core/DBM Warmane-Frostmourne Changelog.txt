General Notes

- This DBM version (4.93) is fully compatible with the previous Warmane version, as well as the latest 3.3.5 release available elsewhere
- Timings are based on my own experience and vods of other guilds on Frostmourne; please send me corrections if a timer is inaccurate.
- Due to what I believe is spell queuing, a lot of abilities have a small amount of randomness. I try to address this by marking these as CD.
  - Frost Blast on Kel'Thuzad, Locust Swarm (cast, not duration) on Anub'Rekhan, Noth's first Blink, and Eonar's Gift are the most random from what I've seen.
